1.53 2012-09-01

    - Updated Documentation and Makefile.PL to acknowledge the original

1.52 2012-01-15

    - Neil Bowers took over maintenance
    - removed code which referred to an undeclared variable in get() method
    - the get() method was always appending a '/' to the URL, which caused
      an URL containing a filename to fail.
    - the testsuite didn't include a trailing '/' on the test URL, so once
      the previous hack was removed, the testsuite failed. This is due to
      a limitation in HTTP::Lite
    - Formatted this file according to CPAN::Changes::Spec
